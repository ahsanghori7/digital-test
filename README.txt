Key Areas for Improvement:

There are several instances where similar operations are performed, like the repetitive response creation with response($response) and repeated code blocks in methods like distanceFeed.
Some methods, such as distanceFeed, handle too many responsibilities and have a high cognitive load due to the number of conditionals and variables.
Lack of validation and proper error handling.
The controller is tightly coupled with the repository. Introducing service classes or breaking down repository methods into more specific services could help in managing responsibilities better.

Refactoring Plan:

Extract common logic for operations like creating responses, handling request data, etc., into separate methods to adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
Methods should be broken down into smaller methods to handle specific tasks such as validating input data, updating the Distance model, and updating the Job model.
Wrap repository method calls in try-catch blocks where exceptions might occur, to handle errors more gracefully.


The conditions in the willExpireAt function seem to have a logical issue in the elseif statements, specifically in the second condition. 
The <= 24 condition overlaps with the first condition of <= 90.
